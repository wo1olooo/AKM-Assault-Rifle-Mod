    <label>AKM</label>
	
    <description>A refined weapon born from the fading twilight of Old Earth — not a desperate prototype, but the perfected legacy of those that came before. Forged during the 1950s in the crumbling Soviet Union, the AKM was the culmination of a brutal design lineage: an answer to the failures of early automatic rifles like the AVS-36 and the AS-44.

Where those weapons faltered, the AKM thrived. Chambered in the 7.62×39mm intermediate round, it struck a rare balance — powerful, controllable, and absurdly durable. Lighter than the AK-47 it succeeded, and far more reliable than its ancestors, the AKM could be built easily and mass, field-stripped in seconds, and trusted across every battlefield — from Earth’s last frozen fronts to the burning, dust-choked colonies of the far Rim.

It was not elegant. It was not rare. But it survived.

Centuries after Earth was lost to silence and ash, a fragmentary cache of AKM schematics was discovered aboard a decaying orbital outpost — half-buried in code corruption and memory rot. A Rimworld weaponsmith, scraping by on a forgotten moon, managed the impossible: to resurrect the design, piece by piece.

Now, the AKM lives again — in the hands of scavengers, settlers, and soldiers alike. Not as a symbol of glory, but of grit. Of purpose. Of survival.

Not rare. Not perfect. Just real — and ready.

A legacy forged in failure. Reborn through fire. Still here.
