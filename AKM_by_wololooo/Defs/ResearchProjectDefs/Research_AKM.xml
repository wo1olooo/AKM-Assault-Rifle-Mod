	<description>Recovered from the shattered databanks of a derelict pre-Fall armory ship, the AKM is one of Old Earth’s most enduring weapons — a refined descendant of the original AK-47.

Designed in the 1950s by the fading Soviet Union, it was built for reliability above all else. Chambered in 7.62×39mm, the AKM was simple to produce, easy to repair, and nearly impossible to kill — a tool for soldiers, rebels, and survivors alike.

Centuries after Earth’s collapse, its design resurfaced in corrupted schematics and salvaged parts. Reassembled on the Rim, it lives again — crude, loud, and unstoppable.

Not rare. Not refined. Just real.
A relic that outlived its world — and refuses to die.
