# AKM Assault Rifle — RimWorld Mod by Wololooo

A lore-rich, rugged automatic rifle from the mythic ruins of Old Earth — rebuilt for survival on the Rim.

The **AKM** is a refined successor to the AK-47, designed during Old Earth’s postwar years by the Soviet Union. Reliable, simple, and durable, it was built to survive war, neglect, and time itself.

Now, centuries after Earth’s fall, fragments of its schematics were recovered aboard a derelict armory ship — and reborn by settlers in the outer worlds.

**Not rare. Not refined. Just real.**
